item, session, and server

- perfer simplicity over performance
- server keeps all items in its hashtables
- session parses commands and calls server to get/set/delete items



IO models: blocking or non-blocking?

- blocking IO, thread per conn
- N threads for N clients
- good for ~100 clients
- constant memory usage
- non-blocking IO, event based
- fixed # threads for N clients
- good for ~1000s clients
- memory usage varies

a third approach: threads for active requests
