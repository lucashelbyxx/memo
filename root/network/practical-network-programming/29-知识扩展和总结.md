extensions and improvements

- reduce overhead by caching file descriptor to /proc/pid/stat
- show CPU usage per thread
- show memory usage over time
- collect machine wide data
  - muduo-protorps/examples/collect
- monitoring processes running on multiple machines
  - a simple HTML with IFRAME could work



a project idea: nohup on web

- a customized HTPP server, fork and run a command line tool, turn its STDOUT/STDERR into web pages
  - watching 'apt-get upgrade' or 'make boost' progress in real time
- security concerns



what is network programming

- level 1: doesn't even know MAC, eg. hubs
- level 2: knows MAC but not IP, eg. switches
- level 3: knows IP but not port, eg. routers
- level 4: knows IP and port, eg. NAT
- level 7: cares about payload, eg. http proxy
  - parse, understand, use, consume and/or produce payload



focus on business logic

- network programming is not about fiddling sockets API
- instead, fit your business logic into the framework and let network library to worry about details
