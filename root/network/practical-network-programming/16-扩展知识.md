Relativity of simultaneity

- according to special theory of relativity, it is impossible to say in an absolute sense that two distinct events occur at the same time if those events are separated in space. it depends on the observer's reference frame.
- distributed system is relativistic

# UTC, TAI, Leap Seconds, Unix Time

- what's wrong with leap seconds?
  - it's added on June 30 00:00:00Z or Dec 31 00:00:00Z, regardless of weekdays and time zones
    - not all peers are synced, you may receive a message from the future
  - clock stops during the leap second, but every time you call gettimeofday(), kernel suppose to fake you an increasing time
    - poorly tested in user code, kernels, NTP clients, even NTP servers
