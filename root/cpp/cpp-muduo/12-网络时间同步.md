# Network Time Synchronization

- daytime (RFC 867), time (RFC 868)
- NTPv3 (RPC 1305), NTPv4 (RFC 5905)



# How NTP works

- measure clock error
  - SCM_TIMESTAMP
- adjust offset and frequency, continuously
- avoid time jump
- deal with leap seconds



# NTP kernel clock discipline

- type II, adaptive-parameter, hybrid(混合的) phase/frequency-lock loop disciplines variable frequency oscillator (VFO) phase and frequency
- NTP daemon computes phase error Vd = θr - θo between source and VFO, then grooms samples to produce time update Vs
- loop filter computes phase x and frequency y corrections and provides new adjustments Vc at 1-s intervals
- VFO frequency is adjusted at each hardware tick interrupt



# Why do we need to know clock error?

- verify NTP works
- measure latency in messaging system
  - timestamps from two clocks are not comparable unless you know their offset (ie. clock error)
