# When short write happens in non-blocking IO

- save remaining data in some buffer
  - never call write() when buffer is not empty, it reorders data
  - alternatively, always send from buffer
- start watching POLLOUT event
  - meanwhile, any write() should append the buffer instead
- when POLLOUT is ready, write from buffer
  - consume buffer
- if buffer becomes empty, stop watching POLLOUT event
  - otherwise, it end up with a busy loop



# What if sink is slow?

- the common pitfall in non-blocking IO
  - avoid memory exhaustion or dropping messages
- stop reading and stop watching readiness
  - otherwise end up with a busy loop in level-triggered IO multiplexer
- sender will be throttled because TCP advertised window drops to zero
- amortized throughput will be the same
  - due to buffering, instant throughput will be different



# Level-trigger and edge trigger?

- select(2) and poll(2) are level-trigger, community has 30+ years of experience on how to write correct code, many 3rd party libraries rely on this
- epoll(5) stands for edge-poll, works in both LT and ET mode
- no up-to-date benchmarks show which is faster
- edge trigger works best for writing and accepting
- level trigger works best for reading data
- current Linux kernel doesn't support mix LT/ET for on socket
  - muduo uses level trigger
