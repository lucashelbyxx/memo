Part II. Current non_blocking network programming



memcached (simplify)



what is memcached?

- first generation of in-memory caching in web era
  - probably the oldest NoSQL, besides BDB
- non-persistent, remote, hash table with LRU
  - simple key/ value store
  - plus some other features like counter
- very simple failure model
  - unlike a database
- largely deprecated by other more advanced NoSQL products



why reimplement memcached?

- simple text based request-response protocol
- serve concurrent clients with multiple IO threads
  - scalable IO model: one-loop-per-thread, not thread per connection
- concurrent requests accessing shared state
  - efficient synchronization by sharding locks
- memory intensive(密集的)
- online profiling with gperftools
- small code base: 1 kloc, excluding networking



basic protocol

- storage (set/add/replace/append/prepend)
  - set <key> <flags> <exptime> <bytes> [noreply]\r\n
  - <data block> \r\n
  - STORED \r\n
- retrieval (get/gets)
  - get <key>*\r\n
  - VALUE <key> <flags> <bytes> [<cas unique>]\r\n
  - <data block>\r\n
  - END\r\n
- deletion
  - delete <key> [noreply]\r\n
  - DELETED\r\n
- compare-and-swap



features supported

- text protocol
- commands
  - get / gets / delete / version / memstat / quit / shutdown
  - set / add / replace / append / prepend / cas
- the most difficult command to support:
  - shutdown
- online profiling
- pass as much unit tests as possible
