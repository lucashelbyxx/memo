# Agenda

- timekeeping, how NTP works
- roundtrip, measure clock error between hosts
- UDP vs. TCP from programming prospective



# The science of time keeping*

- time is the most accurate quantity we measure in our daily life
  - 10 significant figures
  - length, weight, even money, much lower precision, usually 3~4 digits
- a clock = an oscillator(振荡器) + a counter
  - current time = count / frequency + offset
  - the quality (accuracy and stability) of the oscillator dominates
  - quartz crystal oscillators are commonly used
