non-blocking IO to rescue

- code is much more complicated, short read and short write
- application level buffers are needed
- usually non-blocking IO is delegated to a good network library, like libevent, netty, muduo, etc.
- ACE is a bad example, its Reactor only dispatches events, you have to write your own code for non-blocking read/write in every program.



why non-blocking IO is a must

- example from Unix Networking Programming
  - calling accept(2) after a listening socket is "ready for reading" could block, because client could have disconnected in between.
  - under Linux, select() may report a socket fiel descriptor as "ready for reading", while nevertheless a subsequent read blocks. this could for example happen when data has arrived but upon examination has wrong checksum and is discarded. There may be other circumstances in which a file descriptor is spuriously reported as ready. Thus it may be safer to use O_NONBLOCK on sockets that should not block.
